# üöÄ Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

If you haven't already connected to GitHub, follow these steps:

### Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **+** icon (top right) ‚Üí **New repository**
3. Name it: `portafolio` (or any name you prefer)
4. **Don't initialize with README** (you already have files)
5. Click **Create repository**

### Connect Your Local Repository

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Check your current remote
git remote -v

# If no remote exists, add it (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portafolio.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

If you already have a remote, just push:
```bash
git push origin main
```
